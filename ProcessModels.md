## Scenario 4: Developing a Prototype for a Startup's Innovative Idea  
Description:  
- A startup has an innovative idea for a mobile app but is unsure about the exact features users will want.  
- They need a prototype to test the concept with potential investors and users before committing to full development.  

Chosen Process Model: Prototyping Model  Prototyping allows early testing and feedback before full development.  

Justification:  
- Since the features are uncertain, a prototype helps validate the idea with users and investors.

## Scenario 5: Design a New Social Media Platform  
Description:  
- A startup wants to build a social media platform with messaging, photo sharing, and video uploads.  
- The market is competitive, so they need to launch a basic version quickly and improve it based on user feedback.  

Chosen Process Model: Unified Process Model  The Unified Process supports iterative development with continuous improvements.  

Justification:  
- The Unified Process allows the system to be developed in phases, making it easier to adjust based on user feedback.  
- Iterative development ensures the platform evolves as the startup gathers more data from users.

## Scenario 6: Create a Government Tax Collection System  
Description:  
- A government agency needs a nationwide tax collection system that is highly reliable and follows strict regulations.  
- Requirements are well-defined, and there is no room for major changes once development starts.  

Chosen Process Model: Waterfall Model  Waterfall is best for well-defined projects with strict deadlines.  

Justification:  
- Since the requirements are clear, a structured Waterfall approach ensures proper documentation and planning.

## Scenario 7: Develop an AI-based Medical Diagnosis System  
Description:  
- A research team is developing an AI-based medical diagnosis system.  
- The project involves uncertainty, requires large amounts of data, and must improve accuracy through testing.  

Chosen Process Model: Spiral Model  Spiral Model allows for iterative risk management and gradual system refinement.  

Justification:  
- Since AI systems evolve over time, the Spiral Model allows for continuous refinement and risk assessment.

## Scenario 8: Creating a Safety-Critical Air Traffic Control System  
Description:  
- A government agency is building a new air traffic control system.  
- The system must be highly reliable, go through rigorous testing, and manage significant risks.  

Chosen Process Model: Spiral Model  Spiral Model is best for high-risk, complex systems that require continuous testing and validation.  

Justification:  
- The Spiral Model provides incremental development with extensive risk management at each phase.  
- It ensures that critical safety concerns are addressed before full system deployment.
